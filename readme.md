# Response Plots

## Figure 1: Kp = 10

For this plot, we inputted a Kp value of 10. We saw a large overshoot occur on the plot, which signaled to us that the system was underdamped. 

## Figure 2: Kp = 0.012

When looking at this plot, we can also conclude that this system in underdamped. We used a value of 0.012 which still showed a small overshoot on the plot. 


## Figure 3: Kp = 0.0012

For this last plot, we do not see an overshoot. Instead, the curve appears to flatten out as it reaches the desired location position. We used a Kp
